Description:
  The redirection generator creates redirects from one url to another
  (provided the from URL doesn't map to an existing route in your app already).

Example:
  script/generate redirect <from_url> <to_url>

  This will generate:

    RAILS_ROOT
      |- db
          |-migrate
              |- xxx_create_migration_from_url.rb
